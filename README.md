# DataStudio

✏️ **DataStudio**: an IDE for big data diagrams

---

## Introduction

**DataStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for data engineers and scientists working with large and complex data schemas. With DataStudio, you can easily create, visualize, and manipulate your data schemas, as well as export them in various formats for use in different environments and tools. It can also generate a test dataset based on the criteria of the schema.

## Key Features

- **Schema Creation and Editing**: Create and edit complex data schemas with an intuitive user interface.
- **Schema Visualization**: Export your schemas as UML diagrams for better understanding and documentation.
- **Import and Export**: Import existing schemas and export them in multiple formats.

## Available Export Types

DataStudio provides several export options to meet the diverse needs of data engineers:

- **Import a structure**: Import an existing structure. This feature allows you to work with already defined schemas and modify them as needed.
- **Download the structure**: Download the current structure for offline use or backup.
- **Export to XSD**: Export the structure in XML Schema Definition (XSD) format for use in XML-based systems.
- **Export to UML Diagram**: Export the structure as a UML diagram for documentation and visualization purposes.
- **Export to PySpark**: Export the structure for use with PySpark, enabling seamless integration with your big data processing workflows.
- **Export to Scala**: Export the structure for use with Scala, supporting your development in this programming language.

## Generating Test Dataset

**DataStudio** can generate a test dataset based on the criteria defined in the schema, allowing you to quickly create sample data for testing and development purposes.
